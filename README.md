# StepBot
by Nathan Stephenson

StepBot is a Python 2/3 program that will automatically generate stepchart patterns for your StepMania charts based on existing arrows/simfiles.
This program ensures that your steps won't be repetitive, while maintaining the correct rhythm and cues in a song that full chart generators often miss.

Compatible with .ssc files (and probably .sm files but is untested), however only the 0,1,2,3,4,M notes will survive at the moment (this will be fixed soon).
Also supports only one difficulty at the moment, but I will work on fixing that.

Pump stepcharts are also planned, for 6-panel and 9-panel not sure because I have no clue how the patterns work in those games.

Note that this is far from complete and likely does not even work as expected. It is a start though, and I will continue to make it work.
