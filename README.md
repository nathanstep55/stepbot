# StepBot
by Nathan Stephenson

StepBot is a Python 2/3 program that will automatically generate stepchart patterns for your StepMania charts based on existing rhythm.
This program ensures that your steps won't be repetitive, while maintaining the correct rhythm and cues in a song that full chart generators often miss.

Compatible with .sm files (and maybe .ssc files?), although I cannot guarantee that anything outside the 0,1,2,3,M spec will survive.
Also supports only one difficulty at the moment, but I will work on fixing that.

Pump stepcharts are also planned, for 6-panel and 9-panel not sure because I have no clue how the patterns work in those games.
